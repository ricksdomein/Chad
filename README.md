## Installation:

sh CHAD.sh
```
That's it.

## What is CHAD?

CHAD is a script that autoinstalls and autoconfigures a fully-functioning and minimal terminal-and-vim-based Arch Linux environment.

CHAD can be run on a fresh install of Arch or Artix Linux, and provides you with a fully configured diving-board for work or more customization.

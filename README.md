## Installation:

```
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricksdomein/rodenticide/main/INSTALL.sh
sh INSTALL.sh
```
That's it.

## What is rodenticide?

rodenticide is a script that autoinstalls and autoconfigures a fully-functioning and minimal terminal-and-vim-based Arch Linux environment.

`INSTALL.sh` can be run on a fresh install of Arch or Artix Linux, and provides you with a fully configured diving-board for work or more customization.
